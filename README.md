## What Is This?    

This is a *“proxy”*  for the uninitiated. In reality, this is simply a small web page, that will take a submitted URL and add a load of percent-encoded characters[^1], specifically %40, which is the encoded version of @. Adding this before a URL, the newly opened link is difficult to parse for many extensions, and therefore is loaded as if there are none. The reason we are able to add these is the old login method (Thank you Peak). This is tested working with DyKnow and Securely[^3], if you tested it on another blocking extension	and it works, please make an issue. This is very much a work in progress and will require your support. Please star this repository and share it with your friends.

 
 [^1]: **(The method used to bypass extensions is using “percent-encoding", which is under public domain, and therefore not licensable by any party. We have faced threatened strikes over this, so do not listen to someone claiming to "own" %40, (Ex. Someone named "d" on discord))**
[^3]: Linewize is currently known not to work
